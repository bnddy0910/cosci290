Now, let me explain the rules. You're in a tower of total 23 floor, your current floor level is unknown.
This tower used to be the tallest in the country, now it's been cursed and bury in the ground, only the 
top of the tower is beyond the ground, and the bottum floor is full of poison snakes. You will face some 
options to either help you reach the top floor, or will get you to the bottum of this tower, do you want
to play this game?
