Ok class this is our last day together before spring break, Professor Vu said as we all cheered with happiness.
Calm down calm down, just because you're going on a break doesn't mean you can't work. You all will have to do
a report on what you did for break. As the bell began to rang, Adam grabbed his stuff and ran out as fast as
possible to meet up with friends to talk about what the plan is for the break. As that time came for everyone to leave
campus, Adam went home to get some rest. The next day, Adam and his friends all met up at Bill's house before heading out
together. As friends began coming slowly, they started to move the stuff into the car to make the leaving phrase easier.
Once all the friends came, they went to the destination, which was the beach for today. Everyone was waiting for this day to 
come since they all needed a break from school. Upon arriving to the beach, they set up boot camp and began there adventure 
at the beach. But little did Adam and his friends know, something went terribly wrong throughout the day. Adam was the only one who 
saw different clues and strange things happening, but his friends didn't notice anything. As the sun slowly moved down, they packed up and 
went home enjoying there first day of break. Once Adam parked the car on the driveway, he started to unpack the car, but he sense 
someone was behind him and turned around and got knocked out. As Adam closely open his eyes, he was shocked of where he was. As the 
operator saw Adam waking up.
